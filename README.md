# CombinedCodingStats

This was made purely for fun, I use a lot of multiple repositories at work and while freelancing, and always bothered me that I couldn't show my activity easily on my Github README page, since GitHub is almost like my portfolio, so I created this project.

Unfortunately, we can't get the theme the current user is using, so please use the one you think best fits all page themes.

Any suggestions about themes, platforms and project architecture are welcome!


# Usage:

### GitLab stats

Replace `YOURGITLABUSERNAME` with your GitLab user name and `YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` with your GitHub username to avoid redirecting.
!Attention: To display private contributions you need to enable "Include private contributions on my profile" in your GitLab Profile preferences.

```
